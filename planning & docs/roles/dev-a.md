## Role
Design and implement the user interface of the Skill Swap Platform using React and TailwindCSS. Responsible for building modular, accessible, and responsive UI components and pages, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

## Responsibilities
- **Component Development:** Build reusable, pure functional components (e.g., SwapCard, ProfileForm, RequestList) using React Hooks. Ensure components are modular and easy to maintain.
- **Page Construction:** Create main page components (Home, Login, Profile, Requests) and compose them from smaller UI components.
- **Routing:** Set up and manage client-side routing using React Router DOM for smooth navigation between pages.
- **Form Handling & Validation:** Implement forms with React Hook Form and Zod for schema-based validation, providing real-time feedback and preventing invalid submissions.
- **Styling & Responsiveness:** Use TailwindCSS for consistent, mobile-first design. Ensure layouts adapt to all screen sizes and meet accessibility standards.
- **Stateful UI:** Handle loading, error, and empty states gracefully in all components and pages.
- **Accessibility:** Follow ARIA guidelines, ensure keyboard navigation, and use semantic HTML for all interactive elements.
- **UI/UX Enhancements:** Implement pagination, breadcrumbs, search, and filter features where appropriate. Use proper color contrast and design tokens for WCAG compliance.
- **Code Quality:** Avoid hardcoded values; use constants/config files. Run and fix linter issues (ESLint/Prettier). Optimize for fast load and minimal network calls.

## Collaboration
- **API Integration:** Work closely with Dev B to connect UI components to backend APIs, ensuring data flows smoothly and UI updates correctly.
- **UI/UX Review:** Collaborate with Dev C to review and polish UI/UX, address feedback, and ensure accessibility and design consistency.
- **Design System:** Follow and help refine design tokens, spacing, and color palette for a unified look and feel.

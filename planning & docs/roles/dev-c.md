## Role
Ensure the Skill Swap Platform is robust, user-friendly, and well-documented. Responsible for quality assurance, bug fixing, UI/UX polish, accessibility, and maintaining all project documentation. Acts as the final gatekeeper for usability and compliance.

## Responsibilities
- **Testing:** Thoroughly test all user and admin flows (signup, login, swap requests, profile privacy, admin actions) to catch bugs and edge cases early.
- **Bug Fixing:** Investigate, reproduce, and fix reported bugs. Proactively identify potential issues and regression risks.
- **Feedback/Rating System:** Implement and test the user feedback and rating system, ensuring it is intuitive and abuse-resistant.
- **UI/UX Polish:** Refine UI for accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast), theming, and overall user experience. Ensure all interactive elements are responsive and visually clear.
- **Feature Verification:** Check that pagination, breadcrumbs, search, and filter features are present and work as intended.
- **Documentation:** Write and update README, API docs, changelogs, and usage guides. Ensure all features and endpoints are clearly documented for users and developers.
- **Compliance:** Ensure styling and color choices meet WCAG accessibility standards. Run and fix linter issues (ESLint/Prettier) to maintain code quality.
- **Team Collaboration:** Confirm all team members have contributed code and documentation. Review and document edge cases and lessons learned.

## Collaboration
- **UI Review:** Work closely with Dev A to review and polish UI/UX, provide feedback, and ensure accessibility and design consistency.
- **Bug Reporting:** Communicate bugs and usability issues to the team, suggest improvements, and verify fixes.
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation for all features, APIs, and user flows. Share guides and best practices with the team.

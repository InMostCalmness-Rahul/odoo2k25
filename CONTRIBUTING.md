# Contributing to SkillSwap Platform

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the SkillSwap Platform! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Setting Up Development Environment
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone <your-fork-url>`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` in both `/client` and `/server` directories
4. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example` files)
5. Start development servers: `npm run dev` from the root directory

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style and Standards
- **ESLint & Prettier**: All code must pass linting checks
- **Naming Conventions**: 
  - Use camelCase for variables and functions
  - Use PascalCase for React components
  - Use kebab-case for file names
- **Comments**: Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for new features

### Git Workflow
- **Branch Naming**: 
  - `feature/description` for new features
  - `fix/description` for bug fixes
  - `docs/description` for documentation updates
  - `refactor/description` for code refactoring

- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits format
  ```
  feat: add user profile photo upload
  fix: resolve JWT token refresh issue
  docs: update API documentation
  refactor: improve error handling middleware
  ```

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for new functions and components
- Test API endpoints with various input scenarios
- Ensure responsive design works on mobile devices
- Verify accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Backend (Express.js + MongoDB)
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses only
- **Services**: Contain business logic
- **Middleware**: For authentication, validation, and error handling
- **Models**: Define MongoDB schemas with validation
- **Utils**: Helper functions and utilities

### Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)
- **Components**: Small, reusable, single-purpose components
- **Pages**: Route-level components
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- **Context**: For global state (auth, socket, user)
- **Utils**: Helper functions and constants

### Security Best Practices
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Never expose sensitive data in API responses
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

## üîß Development Workflow

### Before Starting Work
1. Check existing issues and pull requests
2. Create or comment on an issue to discuss your approach
3. Create a new branch from `main`
4. Set up your development environment

### During Development
1. Write clean, readable code
2. Add appropriate comments and documentation
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Ensure all linting checks pass
5. Update relevant documentation

### Before Submitting PR
1. Run all tests and ensure they pass
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes
3. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`
